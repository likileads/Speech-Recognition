# Speech-Recognition

- - - - -

- Speech Recognition (SR) is the ability to translate a dictation or spoken word to text. Speech 
Recognition also known as “automatic speech recognition” (ASR) or speech to text (STT). <br>
- In our project, speech recognition software works by breaking down the audio of speech 
recording into individual sounds, analysing each sound, using algorithm to find the most 
probable word fit in the and transcribing those sounds into text. <br>
- The main objective of our project is at understanding and comprehending what was spoken and 
to build a hand-free computing system. <br>

_Initially, the system is in idle mode. As it receives any wake up call it begins execution. 
The received command is identified whether it is a questionnaire or a task to be performed. 
Specific action is taken accordingly. After the question is being answered or the task is being 
performed, the system waits for another command. This loop continues unless it receives quit 
command. At that moment, it goes back to sleep._

_In this project there is only one user. The user queries command to the system. System then 
interprets it and fetches answer. The response is sent back to the user._

_The user sends the request or a command that needs to be processed. The system then 
interprets it and fetches answer, this response is received by the user._

### Result

The resulting system is able to: 
  - Recognize the speech or command of the user.
  - Interpret the speech or command of the user.
  - Convert the speech into text.
  - Respond back to the user with voice output.
  - Fetch accurate information in response to user.
