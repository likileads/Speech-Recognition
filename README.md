# Speech-Recognition

- - - - -

- Speech Recognition (SR) is the ability to translate a dictation or spoken word to text. Speech 
Recognition also known as “automatic speech recognition” (ASR) or speech to text (STT). <br>
- In our project, speech recognition software works by breaking down the audio of speech 
recording into individual sounds, analysing each sound, using algorithm to find the most 
probable word fit in the and transcribing those sounds into text. <br>
The main objective of our project is at understanding and comprehending what was spoken and 
to build a hand-free computing system.
